# Holocracy/Messaging Apps#

This module enhances the mail.group object in order to use it for holocracy processes and nesting message groups into each other. 

## Functions ##

> Holacracy is a social technology or system of organizational governance in which authority and decision-making are distributed throughout a fractal holarchy of self-organizing teams rather than being vested at the top of a hierarchy.[1] Holacracy has been adopted in for-profit and non-profit organizations in the U.S., France, Germany, New Zealand, Australia, and the UK.
